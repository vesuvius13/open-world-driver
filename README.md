## Running Locally

Because this project uses JavaScript ES Modules (`import * as THREE from '...'`), you **cannot** simply open the `index.html` file directly in your browser from the filesystem (`file:///...`). You need to serve it through a local web server.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<vesuvius13>/<open-world-driver>.git
    cd <your-repo-name>
    ```
    *(Replace with your actual username and repo name)*

2.  **Use a simple local server:** The easiest way is often using Node.js:
    *   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
    *   Open your terminal in the project directory (`open-world-driver`).
    *   Run the following command:
        ```bash
        npx serve
        ```
    *   This will start a local server, usually at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address (it will be shown in the terminal).

3.  **Alternatively (VS Code):**
    *   If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the **"Live Server"** extension.
    *   Right-click on the `index.html` file in the VS Code explorer and choose "Open with Live Server".

4.  **Open in browser:** Navigate to the local URL provided by your server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
